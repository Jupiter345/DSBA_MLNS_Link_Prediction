# DSBA_MLNS_Link_Prediction

The network of actors often serves as a representation for their joint
participation in the same movie, personal relation and level of fame,
which is essential to help researchers understand social structures
and develop more effective theories in managing social change.
In this Kaggle competition, we are given an actor co-occurrence
network, where the nodes indicate actors and the edges indicate the
occurrence of actors on the same Wikipedia page. We are going to
predict missing edges in this network, using information from both
the network itself and the pre-processed Wikipedia description to
predict missing edges.
